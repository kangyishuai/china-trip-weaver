# Unresolved items

## Book 2: live 12306 station candidates have no distance signal

- Status: blocked on 2026-09-04 for physical-distance ordering only; the remaining station fallback and error-classification work continues.
- Evidence: pinned `12306-mcp@0.3.10` implements `get-stations-code-in-city` as a list containing only `station_code` and `station_name`. The current rail `ProviderRequest` likewise carries names/refs/date but no station coordinates or candidate-to-endpoint distances.
- Constraint: `planning.py`, `mobility.py`, and AMap providers are explicitly owned by other books and may not be changed here. Querying every candidate for tickets would produce duration, not physical distance, and could still silently choose the wrong station.
- Safe delivery: return every candidate without selecting one; sort ascending when a synthetic/forward-compatible candidate supplies `distance_meters`, with unknown distances last and deterministic ties. Live candidates without a distance remain deterministic but are not claimed to be physically ranked.

One pre-existing open item is parked deliberately below. Standing constraints are not listed here, because a list of unresolved items
should mean pending work. They live where they are enforced:

- Provider terms, attribution, caching, and the licences commercial use would
  require: `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md`.
- Provider pins, deadlines, degradation, and FlyAI's optional status:
  `plugins/china-trip-weaver/references/provider-contracts.md`.
- Architecture decisions, including why this plugin is not listed on a public
  marketplace: `docs/design/adr/`.

## Lodging and flight inventory have a single upstream source

- Status: parked on 2026-09-04. Known, accepted, not scheduled.
- Fact: `@fly-ai/flyai-cli` is the only source for both lodging and flight
  inventory. It is an unofficial third-party wrapper published by an individual
  maintainer, it last shipped on 2026-04-21, and its command surface already
  drifted once between releases. If it is abandoned or changes shape, both
  capabilities disappear together.
- Contained, not solved: `--lodging` defaults to `off`, a probe mismatch fails
  closed, and tests assert that a failing FlyAI still yields a schema-valid
  Trip, reports its own health, invents no flight candidate, and leaves lodging
  to the candidate file. The plugin degrades; it does not break.
- Two candidate second sources are already wired into this repository, which
  makes this smaller than it looks:
  - Flights: the VariFlight adapter already calls `searchFlightsByDepArr`,
    which returns dated schedules for a city pair. Today it only enriches
    FlyAI legs with status and comfort. Promoting it to an independent source
    would give schedules and flight identity without prices.
  - Lodging: the AMap adapter already has a `poi` capability. An accommodation
    category search would give candidate properties with verified coordinates,
    again without prices or availability.
- What either would not give: a price. Both fallbacks would have to publish
  `verify-on-click` rather than a number, which the price contract already
  supports.
- Impact if left as is: a FlyAI outage costs lodging and flight inventory for
  the duration. Nothing else regresses.

## What was closed, and when

- 2026-09-04, same-name Skill detection. Codex shipped
  `codex plugin list --json`, so `ctw doctor` now reads it, walks each enabled
  plugin's `skills/` directory, and reports `skill_conflicts`, exiting non-zero
  on a collision. Verified against a real installation of the older
  `china-travel-assistant`, which does expose `plan-china-trip`.
- 2026-09-04, sample-data redistribution. `demo/` and
  `tests/fixtures/providers/` hold only locally generated synthetic values, and
  a regression test scans every Git-tracked file for the retired markers.
- 2026-09-04, provider terms. AMap and VariFlight were reviewed clause by
  clause. Caching is forbidden and no provider response is cached; attribution
  is required and the rendered footer names every contributing provider;
  commercial use needs licences this project does not hold, which the readme
  and notices state plainly.
- 2026-09-04, public marketplace listing. Decided against in
  [ADR-0013](docs/design/adr/0013-stay-off-the-public-marketplace.md).
- 2026-09-04, FlyAI wrapper terms. Its data is treated under the same
  no-cache, no-redistribution rule, and the wrapper itself is now documented and
  tested as an optional, best-effort source.
